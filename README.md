# Decision-Tree-Regressor
This repository is just to provide you with an overview related to the decision tree regression model.

To understand the decision tree regression model, it's essential to be familiar with some concepts, such as the decision tree algorithm. Here's a brief explanation:

The decision tree algorithm is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. In the context of regression, it is known as the decision tree regression model.

The decision tree algorithm works by recursively partitioning the feature space into smaller regions based on the values of input features. It uses a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a test on a particular feature, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents the final prediction or value.

During training, the decision tree algorithm determines the best feature to split the data and the threshold value for the split, based on a certain criterion (e.g., mean squared error). It continues recursively splitting the data until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum depth or minimum number of samples at a node.

Once the decision tree regression model is trained, it can be used to predict the target value for new instances by traversing the tree based on the features' values.

It's important to note that decision trees are prone to overfitting, meaning they can learn to memorize the training data too well and perform poorly on unseen data. To address this, techniques like pruning, limiting tree depth, or using ensemble methods like random forests or gradient boosting can be employed.
